# Your First Project

## Creating a New Project

OpenFL includes a "create" command that can help generate an empty or sample project for you.

To create an empty project, open a command-prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and run the following command:

    openfl create project HelloWorld

You can replace "HelloWorld" with whatever you want to call your project.

OpenFL contains multiple samples for illustrating different features of the platform. One of the simple samples is called "DisplayingABitmap", as we build our first project, we will quickly walk through the steps to recreate this sample. You can also generate a copy of it yourself using:

    openfl create DisplayingABitmap

## Adding an Image

No matter what you plan to build, you will almost surely need to add an image at some point. This is very simple to do, so let's get started!
