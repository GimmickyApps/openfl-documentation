# Install Haxe

## Automatic Install

You can install Haxe and Neko automatically, using one of the following installers:

 * [Windows](http://haxe.org/file/haxe-3.1.3-win.exe)
 * [Mac](http://haxe.org/file/haxe-3.1.3-osx-installer.pkg)
 * [Linux](http://www.openfl.org/builds/haxe/haxe-3.1.3-linux-installer.tar.gz)

Once Haxe has been installed, [[install Lime|1.2.-Install-Lime]]!

## Manual Install

Although we recommend that you use an automatic install, there is information available at [http://www.haxe.org/download](http://www.haxe.org/download) if you wish to install Haxe manually, or to build from the source.

If you have any problems using a manual install, please try an automatic install before reporting issues. Thanks!

## Troubleshooting

### Windows

The Haxe installer allows you to change the install directory, but we recommend that you use the default ("C:\HaxeToolkit") rather than changing. Installing to another folder (specifically, "C:\Program Files") can result in unexpected behavior, and break your install.

### Mac

If you have any problems installing, you may need to allow applications that are not signed, or distributed from the Mac App Store. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, and make sure the "Allow Applications" setting is set to "Anywhere"

### Linux

Although your distribution may have "haxe" or "neko" packages to install, we highly recommend that you use the automated installer script, or at least use it as the basis for how to install Haxe on your system. Minor nuances between 32-bit and 64-bit systems, particularly while installing a matching Neko install, can be tricky.

The script has been tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, SUSE, Arch Linux and other major distributions. If you have problems or ways we can improve the installer script, let us know!
